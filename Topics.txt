Generic:

T4EU/<target country>/<wagonNr or country-code of the wagon>/<payload>

Codes for the wagons are mapped to an adresses for the bus. 
International phone prefix is sometime more than 2 digits so we should use 
the 2 letter code for the wagon selection as well.

payload:	The port expander PCF8575 supports 16 bits, e.g 2 Bytes
		We should send 2 bytes in payload, for example:
		c=<Byte 1>;v=<Byte 2>
		Key-value-format, seperated by a semicolon seems to be sufficient.
		JSON is also an option.
